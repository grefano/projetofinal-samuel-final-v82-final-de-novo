# paint shop
project made to college - FUP, 1st Semester, final work

# Features
## Menu system
## Input navigation
## Input treatment and validation

# System documentation
to use this system on your project, you'll only need these files:\
**Menu**: class, UI\
**InputNav**: class, way of asking the user a sequence of inputs, '-1' is a reserved keyword that makes the interface go back to the last input  \
**Input**: class, each input is an object of this class. and 2 more classes, InputTreat and InputValidate, these define all functions that will be applied to inputs

having a file to every Menu and submenu is recommended since each option has its own function/process
